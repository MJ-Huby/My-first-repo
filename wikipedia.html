        <p>
            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">coding</a>.<a

            to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">Web developers</a>) and follow standard methods like

            Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment
            to related job positions such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer">graphic

            designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">front-end developer</a>, back-end
            developer, and full-stack developer.<a

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> in 1989 at CERN.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of
            academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> was developed in 1993.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount
            of information.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Soni-2023-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Core
            protocols of web 1.0 were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>, HTML and <a

        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>, a term popularised by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Dougherty">Dale Dougherty</a>, then vice president of O'Reilly,
            during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a

        </p>
        <p>
            Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature
            of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a
            user-focused, read-write online network <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Soni-2023-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities
            such as creating music, files, images, and movies <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The architecture
            of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize
            information flow from independent platforms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">online
                databases</a>.<a

        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions
            a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>, precise information delivery, and improved
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">user experiences</a> based on preferences, history,

        </p>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than
            traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas
            involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.<a

        <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
        <p>The journey of web development technologies began with simple <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> pages in the early days of the internet. Over time,
            advancements led to the incorporation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> for styling and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution
            transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and
            feature-rich web applications we have today.

    <h2>Web development life cycle</h2>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>
            The web development life cycle is a method that outlines the stages involved in building websites and web
            applications. It provides a structured approach, ensuring optimal results throughout the development
            process.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><sup><i>[citation
                        needed]</i></sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>A typical Web Development process can be divided into 7 steps.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided into
            sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of analysis.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-17">[17]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals.
            Keil et al.'s research<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-18">[18]</a>
            identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management commitment and
            misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and
            objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish a web presence should ideally
            align with the organization's corporate information strategy.
        </p>
        <p>The analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Development of a web strategy</li>
            <li>Defining objectives</li>
            <li>Objective analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available resources undergo analysis to determine
            their feasibility. This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Technology analysis:</b>Identification of all necessary technological components and tools for
                constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.</li>
            <li><b>Information analysis:</b>Identification of user-required information, whether static (web page) or
                dynamic (pulled "live" from a database server).</li>
            <li><b>Skills analysis:</b>Identification of the diverse skill sets necessary to complete the project.</li>
            <li><b>User analysis:</b>Identification of all intended users of the site, a more intricate process due to
                the varied range of users and technologies they may use.</li>
            <li><b>Cost analysis:</b>Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of what is
                achievable within a predefined budget.</li>
            <li><b>Risk analysis:</b>Examination of any major risks associated with site development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented. Objectives that cannot be presently
            fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives Document. This documentation
            becomes integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the methodology.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-17">[17]</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Planning: sitemap and wireframe</h3>
        <p>
            It is crucial for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">web developers</a> to be engaged in
            formulating a plan and determining the optimal architecture and selecting the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">frameworks</a>.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup></a>
            Additionally, developers/consultants play a role in elucidating the total cost of ownership associated with
            supporting a website, which may surpass the initial development expenses.
        </p>
        <p>Key aspects in this step are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">Sitemap</a> creation</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Wireframe</a> creation</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">Tech stack</a></li>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-17">[17]</a> </p>
        <p>Key aspects in this step are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout">Page layouts</a></li>
            <li>Review</li>
            <li>Approval</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Design and layout</h3>
        <p>
            Following the analysis phase, the development process moves on to the <a href="#">design</a> phase, which is
            guided by the objectives document. Recognizing the incremental growth of websites and the potential lack of
            good design architecture, the methodology includes iteration to account for changes and additions over the
            life of the site. The design phase, which is divided into <a href="#">Information Design</a> and <a
                href="#">Graphic Design</a>, results in a detailed Design Document that details the structure of the
            website, <a href="#">database data structures</a>, and <a href="#">CGI</a> scripts.*
        </p>
        <p>
            The following step, design testing, focuses on early, low-cost testing to identify inconsistencies or flaws
            in the design. This entails comparing the website's design to the goals and objectives outlined in the first
            three steps. Phases One and Two involve an iterative loop in which objectives in the Objectives Document are
            revisited to ensure alignment with the design. Any objectives that are removed are added to the Wish List
            for future consideration. <a href="#"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Key aspects in this step are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Page layouts</a></li>
            <li>Review</li>
            <li>Approval</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content creation</h3>
        <p>No matter how visually appealing a website is, good communication with clients is critical. The primary
            purpose of content production is to create a communication channel through the user interface by delivering
            relevant information about your firm in an engaging and easily understandable manner. This includes:<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup></a>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing appealing calls to action</li>
            <li>Making creative headlines</li>
            <li>Content formatting for readability</li>
            <li>Carrying out line editing</li>
            <li>Text updating throughout the site development process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The stage of content production is critical in establishing the branding and marketing of your website or web
            application. It serves as a platform for defining the purpose and goals of your online presence through
            compelling and convincing content.</p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>During this critical stage, the website is built while keeping its fundamental goal in mind, paying close
            attention to all graphic components to assure the establishment of a completely working site.</p>
        <p>The procedure begins with the development of the main page, which is followed by the production of interior
            pages. The site's navigational structure is being refined in particular.</p>
        <p>During this development phase, key functionality such as the Content Management System, interactive contact
            forms, and shopping carts are activated.</p>
        <p>The coding process includes creating all of the site's software and installing it on the appropriate Web
            servers. This can range from simple things like posting to a Web server to more complex tasks like
            establishing database connections.</p>
        <h3>Testing, review and launch</h3>
        <p>
            In any web project, the testing phase is incredibly intricate and difficult. Because <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web apps</a> are frequently designed for a diverse
            and often unknown user base running in a range of technological environments, their complexity exceeds that
            of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system">traditional Information Systems </a> (IS). To
            ensure maximum reach and efficacy, the website must be tested in a variety of contexts and technologies. The
            website moves to the delivery stage after gaining final approval from the designer. To ensure its
            preparation for launch, the quality assurance team performs rigorous testing for functionality,
            compatibility, and performance.
        </p>
        <p>Additional testing is carried out, including integration, stress, scalability, load, resolution, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser_compatibility">cross-browser compatibility</a>. When
            the approval is given, the website is pushed to the server via FTP, completing the development process.</p>
        <p>Key aspects in this step are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Test Lost Links</li>
            <li>Use code validators</li>
            <li>Check browser</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Maintenance and updating</h3>
        <p>The web development process goes beyond deployment to include a variety of post-deployment tasks.</p>
        <p>Websites, in example, are frequently under ongoing maintenance, with new items being uploaded on a daily
            basis. The maintenance costs increases immensely as the site grows in size. The accuracy of content on a
            website is critical, demanding continuous monitoring to verify that both information and links, particularly
            external links, are updated. Adjustments are made in response to user feedback, and regular support and
            maintenance actions are carried out to maintain the website's long-term effectiveness.<a

        <h2>Traditional development methodologies</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Debra Howcraft and John Carroll discussed a few traditional web development methodologies in their research
            paper:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-17">[17]</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Waterfall:</b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a> methodology
                comprises a sequence of cascading steps, addressing the development process with minimal iteration
                between each stage. However, a significant drawback when applying the waterfall methodology to the
                development of websites (as well as information systems) lies in its rigid structure, lacking iteration
                beyond adjacent stages. Any methodology used for the development of Web-sites must be flexible enough to
                cope with change.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-17">[17]</a></li>
            <li><b>Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method</b>(SSADM):<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_systems_analysis_and_design_method">Structured
                    Systems Analysis and Design Method</a> (SSADM) is a widely used methodology for systems analysis and
                design in information systems and software engineering. Although it does not cover the entire lifecycle
                of a development project, it places a strong emphasis on the stages of analysis and design in the hopes
                of minimizing later-stage, expensive errors and omissions.[17]</li>
            <li><b>Prototyping:</b> <a href="#">Prototyping</a> is a software development approach in which a
                preliminary version of a system or application is built to visualize and test its key functionalities.
                The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the final product, allowing stakeholders, including
                users and developers, to interact with it and provide feedback.</li>
            <li><b>Rapid Application Development:</b> <a href="#">Rapid Application Development</a> (RAD) is a software
                development methodology that prioritizes speed and flexibility in the development process. It is
                designed to produce high-quality systems quickly, primarily through the use of iterative prototyping and
                the involvement of end-users. RAD aims to reduce the time it takes to develop a system and increase the
                adaptability to changing requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Incremental Prototyping:</b>Incremental prototyping is a software development approach that combines
                the principles of prototyping and <a href="#">incremental development</a>. In this methodology, the
                development process is divided into small increments, with each increment building upon the
                functionality of the previous one. At the same time, prototypes are created and refined in each
                increment to better meet user requirements and expectations.</li>
